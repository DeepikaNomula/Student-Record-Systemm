# Student-Record-Systemm

The Java Student Record System program is designed to manage and store information related to students, including personal details, academic performance, and attendance. The program utilizes object-oriented principles by defining a Student class with attributes such as student ID, name, academic performance, and attendance. The main program, StudentRecordSystem, provides a simple user interface through the console, allowing users to perform actions such as adding students, recording grades, marking attendance, and displaying student records.

Key features of the program include the ability to:

Add students with unique IDs and names.
Record grades for individual courses for each student.
Mark attendance for students.
Display comprehensive student records, including personal details, academic performance, and attendance.

The program demonstrates basic concepts of Java programming, including class and object creation, user input handling, and decision-making structures. It serves as a foundation that can be extended and enhanced to meet specific requirements for managing student information in an educational setting.
